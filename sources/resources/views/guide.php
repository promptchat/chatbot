            Go to the <strong>Button Settings</strong> tab. Here you can customise the colour of the chat bubble to meet the design of your website using the colour picker for the outer and inner regions of the chat bubble.
            Enter a welcome text and position the chat bubble either to the left or right edge of your website. You can auto-open this chatbox to every visitor after a preset time. In the above example this chatbox opens after 5 seconds a visitor arrived.

            Then, head over to the <strong>Calendar tab</strong> where you can find calendars which you will want to make available for your visitors to book various events with you.
            In the above example you will see 3 different calendars.
            Calendars can be built for different departments in the business, or each employee may have his own booking calendar. All calendar based event scheduling can be confirmed via email from the chatbot admin panel.

        <p>
            Then, click on <strong>"edit calendar"</strong> to customise the name for the calendar event and enter a default time duration for each of the events booked by this particular calendar. The scheduler won't allow double booking for same tumeframes and will show booked timeslots as "unavailable for booking" to web visitors. Don't forget to enter the email address where you want to receive new bookings.

            Click on the <strong>Live Chat</strong> tab where you will see a login form. (You will only see this at 1st time login. Here you can enable your chatbox to take live chat requests from website visitors. If you do not yet have credentials for live chat (note, these are different to the chatbot account credentials, see the next slide on where you can create the live chat option for your chatbot.)

            Here is the link where you can <strong>create your live chat account</strong>:
            <a href="<?php echo e(url('/registration-live-chat')); ?>">registration live chat</a>
            You will have to fill in all the required details.
            Note when you enter the domain name, DO NOT use "https:// or www."

            And finally we arrive to the <strong>Chatbots</strong> tab.
            Here is where you can create and customise chatbots for the automation of online sales/support on your website.You can create unlimited chatbots and place them around different pages of your site. A chatbot may be used by multiple employees. In the above example we see 4 different chatbots on this account.

            With your chatbot account you will get a few <strong>chatbot templates</strong> by default. Templates are available for most major industries such as; car dealership, travel agency, estate agency, digital agency, health clinic. You can load a ready made chatbot from one of these templates and make the changes you want by editing the calendars, information request forms, opening times, pricing etc...

        <p>
            Once you loaded a template, simply click on a block and <strong>edit its contents</strong>.
            In this example we edit the highlighted block called "service". Edit the block by clicking the "pencil" icon in the top right corner of the block. Once clicked, the left hand panel will showcase the contents of that block. In this example you can add, rename and remove buttons make them multi selectable etc...

            If you want <strong>your chatbot to ask your web visitor for information</strong> you have a few options. (All visitor input is archived in Statistics for later review and sent to the preset email address of the chatbot user). You can program the chatbot to ask for:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-style">
            <li>general text(for example a description of a support problem)</li>
            <li>email address and telephone number</li>
            <li>integer and decimal numbers</li>
        </ul>

            When you are finished with editing your chatbot, go back to the <strong>Operators tab</strong>.
        </p>
        <ol class="list-style">
            <li>Click on edit (the pencil icon in the top right corner) and pick from the drop down menu which chatbot you want to use with this chatbox. /this operation is not shown in the above screenshot</li>
            <li>Click on the 'eye' icon /shown above/ to see the installation script. Copy it from here and paste it into the footer section of the HTML of your website(s). All CMS systems are supported including WP, Joompla, Drupal etc...</li>
